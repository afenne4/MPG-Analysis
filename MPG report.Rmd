```{r libraries}
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)
library(dplyr)


```

```{r initial data examination}
mtdat<-mtcars
str(mtdat)
```

Based on this output, it appears that many numeric variables need to be converted
to factors especially the am variable since that is of particular interest

```{r converting variables to factors}
mtdat$cyl<-factor(mtcars$cyl)
mtdat$vs<-factor(mtcars$vs,labels=c("V-Shaped","Straight"))
mtdat$am<-factor(mtcars$am,labels=c("Automatic","Manual"))
mtdat$gear<-factor(mtcars$gear)
mtdat$carb<-factor(mtcars$carb)
```

Now lets look at a summary of the data
```{r summary of data}
summary(mtdat)
```
